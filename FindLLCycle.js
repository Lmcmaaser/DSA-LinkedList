// Write an algorithm to find whether a linked list has a cycle (i.e., whether a node in the list has its next value pointing to an earlier node in the list). For this exercise, create a linked list with the name CycleList. Be sure to insert nodes in the list so that it has a cycle. Then test your program with a cycleList function.

function CycleList() {
  let cll = new LinkedList();

  cll.insertFirst(2);
  cll.insertLast(4);
  // unsure how to create a linked list with a cycle
}
